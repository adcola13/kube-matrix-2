# **Kube-Matrix**

## **Overview**

**Kube-Matrix** **(AWS + Kubernetes Internal Developer Platform (IDP))** is a structured, modular Kubernetes deployment framework designed to manage multiple environments consistently. It enables teams to follow GitOps principles, reuse modules, automate deployments, and maintain clean, scalable environment configuration.

It is a fully automated, production-grade Internal Developer Platform (IDP) that enables development teams to deploy, scale, and manage cloud-native applications on AWS using Kubernetes (EKS). The platform is provisioned entirely through Terraform following best practices for multi-account, multi-region architectures.

This project aims to standardize how Kubernetes environments (dev, staging, prod) are defined, bootstrapped, and deployed.

## 🚀 **Key Features**

* Multi-environment Kubernetes configuration

* Clean directory-based separation of concerns

* Reusable modules for infra and application deployments

* GitOps-friendly repo structure

* Automation workflows (GitHub Actions)

* Sanity test suite for quick verification

##  **Core Principles**
- **No hardcoding** of regions, partitions, account IDs, ARNs  
- **Multi-region & multi-account ready**
- **Strict naming & tagging conventions**
- **Developer access to Dev only**
- **Stage/Prod accessible only via CI/CD**
- **Parameter Store for all credentials**
- **Reusable, modular Terraform codebase**

## **Standard Naming Convention to be followed**
A consistent naming convention ensures clarity across multi-account, multi-region, multi-environment deployments.

-**General Format**
`<project>-<component>-<environment>-<region>`

-Project name is going to be **Kube Matrix (km)**

-**Variable Definitions**
- project → short project code (ex: km for kube matrix)
- component → vpc, eks, ng, db, ecr, sg, rtb, subnet, etc.
- environment → dev / stage / prod
- region → aws region shorthand (ap-south-1 → aps1)

-**Rules**
- All lowercase
- Use hyphens, never underscores
- Avoid special characters
- Keep names short but meaningful
- Environment always included except global resources

## 📌 **Project Implementation**
This project implements an enterprise-grade Internal Developer Platform with:

- Terraform S3 backend + DynamoDB Lock Table
- AWS Networking (VPC, Subnets, NAT, IGW, Endpoints)
- Amazon EKS Cluster with ALB and Autoscaling controllers
- Aurora MySQL Serverless v2 Database
- Amazon ECR for container image storage
- IAM roles, policies, and security boundaries
- Developer access via kubeconfig generation
- CI/CD-ready environment separation (Dev, Stage, Prod)

## **Getting Started**

### **1\. Clone the repository**

````
git clone https://github.com/AnuradhaVIyer/kube-matrix-2.git
